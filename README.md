## 🧠 About Me

I'm Shak — a first-year Computer Science student trying to make the most of every keystroke.  
Right now, I'm focused on building strong fundamentals in programming, algorithms, and problem-solving.

- 🧪 Learning through university projects (mostly in C++)
- 🧠 Exploring ideas for a **habit-tracking app** I plan to build
- 🎥 Planning a **YouTube channel** to share my journey (not launched yet)
- 🌱 Growing my skills in React, Python, and C++

> I'm not there yet, but I'm working towards it every day.
